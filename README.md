# Git Lesson

This lesson covers the basics of using Git for version control.

This lesson is for the first day of the MSSE bootcamp.

To make a commit (or "version" or "checkpoint") of your files, follow this procedure:

1. Make changes to your project that you would like to keep.
2. When you have your changes, tell git you are ready to create a commit by adding files to the staging area using "git add file name".
3. Create checkpoint using "git commit -m "message about what was done""
